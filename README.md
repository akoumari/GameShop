# GameShop

A fun little project that could be easily integrated in a text based RPG. It is a weapons shop that allows you to add weapons to the inventory, print the contents of your bag and shop inventory, remove items from the shop, and buy weapons.

Inventory is implemented as a BST and the players bag is implemented as a linked list.
